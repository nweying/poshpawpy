## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Posh Pawpy Website Colour Codes](assets/readme-images/poshpawpy-colorcodes.png)

Throughout the Posh Pawpy website and also for the logo, I used a palette of pastel colors in order to radiate warmth and friendliness. The colour palette was created using the [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) website.

### Typography

Poppins from Google Fonts is used as the primary font for all the headings and body text throughout the website due to its clean and modern appearance as well as its readability.

| Testimonial texts overlapping in smaller screen sizes | Updated media query and adjusted text positioning in CSS |
| Testimonial images stretching | Removed unnecessary CSS rule defining image dimensions |
| Map and Operating Hours in footer overlapping in medium screen sizes | Set up additional media query for medium screen sizes, adjusted map width, reduced  text font size |
| Images not appearing on deployed site | Corrected relative file path to ensure proper image display |
| Service and pricing table not responsive on smaller screen sizes | Created a vertical table specifically for smaller screens where the original horizontal table is hidden |
