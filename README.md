## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Posh Pawpy Website Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/poshpawpy-color-palette.png)
![Posh Pawpy Website Colour Codes](assets/readme-images/poshpawpy-colorcodes.png)

Throughout the Posh Pawpy website and also for the logo, I used a palette of pastel colors in order to radiate warmth and friendliness. The colour palette was created using the [Colot Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) website.

### Typography

Poppins from Google Fonts is used as the primary font for all the headings and body text throughout the website due to its clean and modern appearance as well as its readability.

### Imagery

All images used including hero images, logo, icons, gallery images were taken from online platforms which have been credited in the [credits](#Credits) section.
